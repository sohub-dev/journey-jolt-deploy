# JourneyJolt 🚀

An AI Agent for planning your trips and elevate your travelling experience.

**JourneyJolt – The best way to plan your next adventure.**

## Tech Stack

JourneyJolt is built with modern and reliable technologies:

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, ShadCN
- **Backend**: Node.js, Drizzle
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Better Auth, Google OAuth

## Getting Started

## Prerequisites

**Required Versions:**

- Node.js >= 18.0.0
- pnpm >= 8.0.0
- Docker >= 20.10.0

Before running the application, you'll need to set up several services and environment variables:

1. **Setup Local Services with Docker**

- Make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) installed.
- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/socratesomiliadis/journey-jolt.git`
- Install all dependencies: `pnpm install`
- Copy the example env, `cp .env.example .env`
- Run `pnpm docker:up` to start the database and other services.
- Run `pnpm db:push` to sync your schema with the database
- Use `pnpm db:studio` to view and manage your data

2. **Better Auth Setup**

- Open `.env` and change the BETTER_AUTH_SECRET to a random string. (Use `openssl rand -hex 32` to generate a 32 character string)

  ```env
  BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=your_secret_key
  ```

3. **Google OAuth Setup (Optional)**

- Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
- Create a new project
- Enable the Google OAuth2 API
- Create OAuth 2.0 credentials (Web application type)
- Add authorized redirect URIs:
  - `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/google/callback"` (development)
  - `https://your-production-url/api/auth/google/callback` (production)
- Add to `.env`:

  ```env
  GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
  GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
  GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/api/auth/google/callback
  ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` must match **exactly** what you configure in the Google Cloud Console, including the protocol (http/https), domain, and path - these are provided above.

## Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure the following variables:

```env
# Next.js
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Auth
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=                     # Required: Secret key for authentication
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000   # Must match the app url for the authentication process to work properly


# Database
DATABASE_URL=                           # Required: PostgreSQL connection string

# AI
OPENAI_API_KEY=                         # Key to access openAI API
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=           # Key to access Google Gemini API
AI_PROVIDER=                            # Select which AI model will assist, values:{"google", "openAI"}
                                        # Default and Best model is Google's Gemini

# Google OAuth (Optional)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=                       # Required for Gmail integration
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=                   # Required for Gmail integration
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=                    # Required for Gmail integration

```

## Running Locally

Run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
